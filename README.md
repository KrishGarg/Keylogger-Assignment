# Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project involves creating a basic keylogger that captures keystrokes in the background and logs them to a text file. It can be expanded with additional features like stealth mode, clipboard logging, or screenshot capturing.

## Features
- **Basic Keylogging**: Captures all keystrokes including special keys (e.g., Shift, Enter).
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
- **File Logging**: Logs captured keystrokes into a file (`keylog.txt`).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `pynput` library for capturing keystrokes.

### Install the Required Library
Install the `pynput` library using pip:
```bash
pip install pynput
